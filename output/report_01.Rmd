# Introduction  
The basic goal of this project is to generate a Machine Learning model (or models) that predicts hectares in Mexico of Eastern Monarchs (a problematic, but common measure of population success). A few challenges:  
1. There are only ~ 24-25 years of data.  
2. What features/variables do we use?  

## ML with Small Data  

The strategy here is to build a full feature set for our small "real" data, and then use the `synthpop` package to generate a larger data set (~25k observations)
